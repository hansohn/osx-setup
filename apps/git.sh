# `git config --global` behind an `if [ ! -f ~/.gitconfig ]` guard, which meant
# they landed once on a fresh machine and never again -- any setting added
# later never reached a machine that already had a gitconfig.
#
# Identity is the one part that cannot ship in a public repo, so it stays here
# and is derived from config.sh into ~/.gitconfig.local, which the tracked
# .gitconfig pulls in with [include].
