# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased](unreleased)

FEATURES:

- repository renamed from osx-setup to mac-setup. GitHub keeps a redirect, so
  existing clones and links continue to work
- packages are declared in a Brewfile and installed with a single
  `brew bundle install`. bootstrap.sh drops from 214 lines to 97: the four
  package arrays and their four install loops are gone, along with the
  hand-written idempotency guards brew bundle makes unnecessary
- a Makefile exposes brew/install, brew/check, brew/drift and brew/dump.
  brew/drift lists packages installed but never declared, which is how the
  previous hand-maintained list fell years out of date
- .gitignore expanded from gitignore.io with the macos, linux, vim and
  visualstudiocode templates

APPLICATIONS ADDED:

- previously installed by apps/ scripts, now declared: bash, bash-completion,
  git, iterm2, macvim, openssl, packer, pyenv, pyenv-virtualenv, terraform,
  hashicorp-vagrant
- required by the dotfiles and neovim configs but never declared: ghostty,
  gcloud-cli, zulu@21, opencode, selene
- added during curation: 1password-cli, chatgpt, claude-code, eksctl,
  goimports, kubectx, maven, microsoft-teams, ollama, signal, speedtest,
  tfsec, uv, watch

APPLICATIONS REMOVED:

- brooklyn, tfswitch, font-iosevka-nerd-font, font-jetbrains-mono-nerd-font
  and yamlfmt. The fonts are unused -- ghostty asks only for Hack Nerd Font --
  and nothing references yamlfmt
- five apps/ scripts that only installed: openssl, packer, terraform, fonts
  and python

BUG FIXES:

- apps/iterm2.sh configured only on first install. Its shell integration and
  six colour schemes sat inside an `if ! brew ls iterm2` guard, so a re-run
  configured nothing
- bootstrap.sh ran the apps/ scripts before installing packages, which only
  worked while each script installed its own. Order is now homebrew, then
  brew bundle, then configuration
- two Packers were installed: apps/packer.sh used the core formula while the
  tap version was also present. HashiCorp moved Packer out of homebrew-core,
  so the tap is canonical
- docker, wireshark and virtualbox@beta were renamed upstream to
  docker-desktop, wireshark-app and virtualbox
- README named brew_formulae, brew_casks and mas_apps as the authoritative
  lists after they had been removed, still listed tfswitch, and described
  Claude Code as a desktop app when it is terminal-based

## [0.9.0](https://github.com/hansohn/osx-setup/compare/0.8.0..0.9.0) (Aug 16, 2026)

FEATURES:

- macOS defaults rewritten for macOS 26. Settings now address preference
  domains rather than plist file paths, which cfprefsd can overwrite
- firewall configured through socketfilterfw instead of the retired
  com.apple.alf domain
- battery percentage set via com.apple.controlcenter, the domain that replaced
  com.apple.menuextra.battery
- Dock, Finder and menu bar are restarted so settings apply without a logout
- nvm installed from homebrew
- renovate scoped to github-actions and moved to the repo root. It had been
  configured for terraform, which this repo contains none of, so it could
  never have matched anything

BUG FIXES:

- packer and vagrant no longer install packer-completion and
  vagrant-completion, both removed from homebrew-core
- apps/terraform.sh installs tflint as a cask; there is no tflint formula
- apps/terraform.sh matches installed formulae on the bare token, so
  tap-qualified names no longer reinstall on every run
- screenshot directory test used -f against a directory, so mkdir ran every
  invocation
- GitHub Actions pinned to releases; two tracked a moving branch
- shellcheck workflow now runs on pull requests, which pull_request nesting
  had prevented
- README tagline and description no longer pinned to the retired OSX name or
  to a single job title
- README prose unwrapped to one line per paragraph, matching the rest of the
  file
- licence copyright range extended to 2026

APPLICATIONS REMOVED:

- chefdk, docker, hadoop, java, nodejs, ruby and virtualbox helper scripts,
  none of which bootstrap.sh could reach. The docker and virtualbox casks
  already cover those two

## [0.8.0](https://github.com/hansohn/osx-setup/compare/0.7.0..0.8.0) (Aug 16, 2026)

First release since 0.7.0 in February 2019.

FEATURES:

- package lists consolidated into brew_formulae, brew_casks and mas_apps
- neovim replaces vim as the primary editor, with a LazyVim configuration
- tmux configuration added
- zshrc rewritten and resolves homebrew through BREW_PREFIX, so it works on
  Apple Silicon
- shellcheck GitHub Action added

APPLICATIONS ADDED:

- cloud and kubernetes: argocd, aws-vault, awscli, doctl, helm, istioctl,
  k9s, kind, kubernetes-cli, kustomize, session-manager-plugin
- infrastructure as code: ansible, ansible-lint, cfn-lint, terraform-docs,
  terraform-ls, terragrunt, tflint, tfswitch
- shell and editors: neovim, tmux, zsh, bat, fd, fzf, gh, lazygit, ripgrep,
  tree, tree-sitter
- languages: lua, luajit, luarocks
- linting: golangci-lint, jsonlint, shellcheck, yamllint
- utilities: gnupg, grep, ipcalc, mas, nmap
- applications: 1password, discord, obsidian, raycast, rectangle,
  visual-studio-code, zoom, font-hack-nerd-font
- mac app store: Amphetamine, Decompressor, iMazing HEIC Converter, Kindle

APPLICATIONS REMOVED:

- aerial, anaconda, apache-directory-studio, atom, brooklyn, caffeine,
  chefdk, dropbox, flux, hadoop, intellij-idea-ce, meld, pycharm-ce, sbt,
  spectacle, transmission

BUG FIXES:

- tflint declared as a formula, which no longer exists, aborting the install
- terminal colorscheme guard was a double negative and only applied the
  setting when it was already correct
- rust nightly toolchain unreachable through a dev/null typo
- oh-my-zsh never installed while zshrc was linked and sourced it
- neovim configuration copied but never symlinked, so it never loaded
- .tmux.conf entries created dangling symlinks
- install guards for tapped formulae, mas apps, fonts and vagrant could never
  match, so those packages reinstalled on every run
- homebrew installer appended to ~/.zprofile even when it was a symlink
- pubkey alias pointed at a key file that no longer exists
